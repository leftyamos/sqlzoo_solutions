FROM ge
WHERE constituency = 'S14000021'
ORDER BY party, yr;


4. Use PARTITION BY constituency to show the ranking of each party in 
Edinburgh in 2017. Order your results so the winners are shown first, then ordered 
by constituency:

SELECT constituency, party, votes,
       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY constituency
                   ORDER BY votes DESC) AS ranking
FROM ge
WHERE constituency BETWEEN 'S14000021' AND 'S14000026' AND
      yr = 2017
ORDER BY ranking, constituency;


5. Show the parties that won for each Edinburgh constituency in 2017:

SELECT constituency, party

COVID-19 Data

1. Modify the query to show data from Spain:

SELECT name, DAY(whn), confirmed, deaths, recovered
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Spain' AND
      MONTH(whn) = 3 AND
      YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;


2. Modify the query to show confirmed for the day before:

SELECT name, DAY(whn), confirmed,
       LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY name
                              ORDER BY whn) AS lagging
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy' AND
      MONTH(whn) = 3 AND
      YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;


3. Show the number of new cases for each day, for Italy, for March:

SELECT name, DAY(whn),
       confirmed - (LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY name
                                           ORDER BY whn)) AS new
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy' AND
      MONTH(whn) = 3 AND
      YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;


4. Show the number of new cases in Italy for each week in 2020 - show Monday only:

SELECT name,
       DATE_FORMAT(whn, '%Y-%m-%d'),
       confirmed - (LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY name
                                           ORDER BY whn)) AS new
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy' AND
      WEEKDAY(whn) = 0 AND
      YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn;


5. Show the number of new cases in Italy for each week - show Monday only.
In the sample query we JOIN this week tw with last week lw using the DATE_ADD function:

SELECT tw.name, 
       DATE_FORMAT(tw.whn,'%Y-%m-%d'), 
       (tw.confirmed - lw.confirmed) AS new_per_week
FROM covid tw 
LEFT JOIN covid lw 
 ON DATE_ADD(lw.whn, INTERVAL 1 WEEK) = tw.whn
    AND tw.name = lw.name
WHERE tw.name = 'Italy' AND
      WEEKDAY(tw.whn) = 0
ORDER BY tw.whn;


6. Include the ranking for the number of deaths in the table:

SELECT name,
       confirmed,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY confirmed DESC) rc,
       deaths,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY deaths DESC) rd
FROM covid
WHERE whn = '2020-04-20'
ORDER BY confirmed DESC;


7. Show the infect rate ranking for each country. Only include countries with a 
population of at least 10 million:

SELECT world.name,
       ROUND(100000*confirmed/population,0) AS rate,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY confirmed/population) AS rank
FROM covid 
JOIN world 
 ON covid.name = world.name
WHERE whn = '2020-04-20' AND 
      population > 10000000
ORDER BY population DESC;


8. For each country that has had at last 1000 new cases in a single day, show the 
date of the peak number of new cases:

WITH temp2 AS (
 WITH temp1 AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT name, 
               DATE_FORMAT(whn, '%Y-%m-%d') AS date, 
               confirmed - (LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY name
                                              ORDER BY whn)) AS new
        FROM covid) AS x
  WHERE x.new > 1000
  )

 SELECT *,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY name
                    ORDER BY new DESC) AS rank
 FROM temp1
 )

SELECT name, date, new
FROM temp2
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY date;
