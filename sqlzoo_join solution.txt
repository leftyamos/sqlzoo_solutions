WHERE teamid != 'GER' AND
      (team1 = 'GER' OR team2 = 'GER');

SELECT teamname, COUNT(*) FROM goal
JOIN eteam
 ON goal.teamid = eteam.id
GROUP BY teamname;


10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium:

SELECT stadium, COUNT(*) FROM goal
JOIN game

GROUP BY stadium;


11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored:

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*) FROM goal

GROUP BY matchid, mdate;


12. For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER':

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*) FROM goal
JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid = game.id
WHERE teamid = 'GER'
GROUP BY matchid, mdate;


13. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not 
been explained in any previous exercises. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.

SELECT mdate, 
       team1,
       SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
           END) AS score1,
       team2,
       SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
           END) AS score2
FROM goal
RIGHT JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid = game.id
GROUP BY mdate, team1, team2
ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
