The JOIN operation

1. Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. 
To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER':

SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
WHERE teamid = 'GER';


2. Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012:

SELECT id, stadium, team1, team2 FROM game
WHERE id = 1012;


3. Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal:

SELECT player, teamid, stadium, mdate FROM goal
JOIN game
 ON (goal.matchid = game.id)
WHERE teamid = 'GER';


4. Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%':

SELECT team1, team2, player FROM game
JOIN goal
 ON game.id = goal.matchid
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%';


5. Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10:

SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime FROM goal
JOIN eteam
 ON goal.teamid = eteam.id
WHERE gtime <=10;


6. List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach:

SELECT mdate, teamname FROM game
JOIN eteam
 ON game.team1 = eteam.id
WHERE coach = 'Fernando Santos';


7. List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw':

SELECT player FROM goal
JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid = game.id
WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw';


8. Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany:

SELECT DISTINCT player FROM goal
JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid = game.id
WHERE teamid != 'GER' AND
      (team1 = 'GER' OR team2 = 'GER');


9. Show teamname and the total number of goals scored:

SELECT teamname, COUNT(*) FROM goal
JOIN eteam
 ON goal.teamid = eteam.id
GROUP BY teamname;


10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium:

SELECT stadium, COUNT(*) FROM goal
JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid= game.id
GROUP BY stadium;


11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored:

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*) FROM goal
JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid = game.id
WHERE team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'
GROUP BY matchid, mdate;


12. For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER':

SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*) FROM goal
JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid = game.id
WHERE teamid = 'GER'
GROUP BY matchid, mdate;


13. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not 
been explained in any previous exercises. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.

SELECT mdate, 
       team1,
       SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
           END) AS score1,
       team2,
       SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
           END) AS score2
FROM goal
RIGHT JOIN game
 ON goal.matchid = game.id
GROUP BY mdate, team1, team2
ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
