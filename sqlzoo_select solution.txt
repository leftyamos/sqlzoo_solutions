SELECT basics

1. Modify it to show the population of Germany:

SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany';


2. Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark':

SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name in ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');


3. Which countries are not too small and not too big? 
BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). 
The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. 
Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area 
between 200,000 and 250,000:

SELECT name, area FROM world
WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 and 250000;

SELECT from WORLD Tutorial

1. Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and 
population of all countries:

SELECT name, continent, population FROM world;


2. Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 
200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros:

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000;


3. Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at 
least 200 million:

SELECT name, gdp/population AS 'per capita GDP' FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000;


4. Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 
'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions:

SELECT name, population/1000000 FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America';


5. Show the name and population for France, Germany, Italy:

SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE name in ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy');


6. Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United':.

7. Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, 
population and area:

SELECT name, population, area FROM world
WHERE area > 3000000 OR
      population > 250000000;


8. Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) 
or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population 
and area:

SELECT name, population, area FROM world
WHERE (area> 3000000 OR population> 250000000) AND NOT
      (area> 3000000 AND population> 250000000);


9. For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both 
to 2 decimal places:

SELECT name, 
       ROUND(population/1000000,2), 
       ROUND(gdp/1000000000,2) 
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America';


10. Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000:

SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population,-3) FROM world
WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000;


11. Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number 
of characters:

SELECT name, capital FROM world
WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital);


12. Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. 
Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word:

SELECT name, capital FROM world
WHERE LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital,1) AND NOT

13. Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name:

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%' AND

      name LIKE '%u%' AND
      name NOT LIKE '% %';
