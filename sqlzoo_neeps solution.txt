1. Give the room id in which the event co42010.L01 takes place:

SELECT room FROM event
WHERE id LIKE 'co42010.L01';


2. For each event in module co72010 show the day, the time and the place:

SELECT dow, tod, room FROM event
WHERE modle LIKE 'co72010';


3. List the names of the staff who teach on module co72010:

SELECT DISTINCT name 
FROM event
JOIN teaches
 ON event.id = teaches.event
JOIN staff
 ON teaches.staff = staff.id
WHERE modle LIKE 'co72010';


4. Give a list of the staff and module number associated with events using 
room cr.132 on Wednesday, include the time each event starts:

SELECT name, modle, tod 
FROM event
JOIN teaches
 ON event.id = teaches.event
JOIN staff
 ON teaches.staff = staff.id
WHERE room LIKE 'cr.132' AND dow LIKE 'Wednesday';


5. Give a list of the student groups which take modules with the word 'Database' 
in the name:

SELECT DISTINCT name 
FROM event
JOIN attends
 ON event.id = attends.event
JOIN student

WHERE modle IN (SELECT id FROM modle
                WHERE name LIKE '%Database%');

6. Show the 'size' of each of the co72010 events. Size is the total number of 
students attending each event:

SELECT event.id, SUM(sze)
FROM event
JOIN attends
 ON event.id = attends.event
JOIN student
 ON attends.student = student.id
WHERE modle LIKE 'co72010'
GROUP BY event.id;


7. For each post-graduate module, show the size of the teaching team. (post 
graduate modules start with the code co7):

SELECT modle, COUNT(DISTINCT name) 
FROM event
JOIN teaches
 ON event.id = teaches.event
JOIN staff
 ON teaches.staff = staff.id
WHERE modle IN (SELECT id FROM modle
WHERE id LIKE 'co7%')
GROUP BY modle;


8. Give the full name of those modules which include events taught for fewer 
than 10 weeks:

SELECT DISTINCT name 
FROM modle
JOIN event
 ON modle.id = event.modle
JOIN occurs
 ON occurs.event = event.id
GROUP BY event.id, name
HAVING COUNT(week) < 10;


9. Identify those events which start at the same time as one of the co72010 lectures:

SELECT id FROM event
WHERE CONCAT(dow, tod) IN (SELECT CONCAT(dow, tod) FROM event
                           WHERE modle LIKE 'co72010');
