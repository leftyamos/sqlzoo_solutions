WHERE guest_id = 1183;


2. When do they get here? List the arrival time and the first and last names 
for all guests due to arrive on 2016-11-05, order the output by time of arrival:

SELECT arrival_time, 
       first_name, last_name
FROM booking

 ON booking.guest_id = guest.id
WHERE booking_date = '2016-11-05'
ORDER BY arrival_time;


3. Look up daily rates. Give the daily rate that should be paid for bookings with 
ids 5152, 5165, 5154 and 5295. Include booking id, room type, number of occupants 
and the amount:

SELECT booking_id, room_type_requested, occupants, amount 
FROM booking
JOIN rate
 ON (booking.room_type_requested = rate.room_type AND
     booking.occupants = rate.occupancy)
WHERE booking_id IN (5152, 5165, 5154, 5295);


4. Who’s in 101? Find who is staying in room 101 on 2016-12-03, include first name,

5. How many bookings, how many nights? For guests 1185 and 1270 show the number of 
bookings made and the total number of nights. Your output should include the guest 
id and the total number of bookings and the total number of nights:

6. Ruth Cadbury. Show the total amount payable by guest Ruth Cadbury for her room 
bookings. You should JOIN to the rate table using room_type_requested and occupants:

    booking.occupants = rate.occupancy
WHERE first_name = 'Ruth' AND last_name = 'Cadbury';

FROM extra
WHERE booking_id = 5346
GROUP BY booking_id
)

SELECT (amount + extra_amount) AS total 
FROM booking
JOIN rate
 ON booking.room_type_requested = rate.room_type AND

        WHEN SUM(nights) IS NULL THEN 0
        ELSE SUM(nights)
